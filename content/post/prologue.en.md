This is my personal blog which documents my academic notes and (mainly) other non-academic abracadabra. Hope you find it not too uninteresting.

The name of this blog is inspired by Neal Stephenson's novel, _Cryptonomicon_, which means "cryptographer's bible". I'll log down pieces of knowledge I've been collecting while lost in the rain forest of Computational Biology (that's why "cell" is embedded in "Miscellonomicon"). I want it to convey a feeling while you're reading, which is we're doing something really exciting right now, just like cryptographers' work (maybe sounds not that exciting already).
